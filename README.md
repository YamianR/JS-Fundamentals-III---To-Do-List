# JS-Fundamentals-III---To-Do-List

## Overview

This project is a basic web application that allows a user to add/remove/cross out items in a to-do list. You can cross out an item by click on an already existing item, or remove an item by double clicking it.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file that works as the skeleton of our webpage.
- `style.css`: The styling sheet for the webpage
- `index.js`: This code is what allows the user to add/remove/cross out items in the to-do list.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field.
3. Click on a task to mark it as complete
4. Double click on a task to remove it.

## Styling

- The background color of the page is set to `#6FA8DC`.
- The main content is contained within a box with a background color of `#fffaed` and a subtle shadow.
- The box has a 6-degree rotation animation.
- The `h1` element inside the box has a background color of `#f4cccc`.
- Survey link is included in the heading.

## JavaScript Logic

- The JavaScript file (`index.js`) handles the addition and removal of to-do list items.
- When a task is clicked, it is marked with a line-through style.
- When a task is double-clicked, it is removed from the list.

## Survery

Do not worry about this.
